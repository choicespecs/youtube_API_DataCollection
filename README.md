# youtube_API_DataCollection

### Introduction
This is a current work in progress, which is constantly being updated as I collect more and more information. This is meant to be a collection of relevant functions that can be used within a python IDE or jupyter notebook. However; if being used it should have the relevant libraries downloaded. 

### Functions and Limitations
_Right now, the current build is only meant to return a dataframe of max viewed videos within a specific time period. I didn't want to give too many functions yet, because I didn't want to over complicate the function. It's very limited as of the current build because the search parameters are only going to return maxViewed videos, however; the function is a bit adjustable depending on what you are looking for, but this needs to be adjusted within the function in code NOT based upon user input._

**UPDATE:** I updated the function to include more options for users to put in information. This is currently not complete, but on it's way to being more functional for other users.

### Future Improvements
_I think I'll continue to add other functions, possibly even work this code within javascript to make it more user friendly._

**UPDATE:** There are some potential bugs, I need to fix. There is some index errors and other issues with the program.
